<h1>TJ MAD Lecture Repository <img align="right" src="./assets/general/tj_mad_logo_full.png" height="40"></h1>

This is the main repo for all TJ MAD lecture-related files. This includes code snippets, presentations, extra resources, etc. The repo is split up into **school** years, but all previous years go into the archived folder. To view the lectures for this year, go to the [**24-25**](/24-25) folder.

There is also a [resources](/resources) folder that is mainly for guides such as installing Flutter, Android Studio, etc. Extra resources are also posted there such as links to relevant documentation. The assets folder is for supporting files in lectures such as images. 

Please contribute to this repo if you have any suggestions!
